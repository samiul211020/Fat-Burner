            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>A dietitian, medical dietitian, or dietician is an expert in identifying and treating disease-related
                malnutrition and in conducting medical nutrition therapy, for example designing an enteral tube feeding
                regimen or mitigating the effects of cancer cachexia. Many dietitians work in hospitals and usually see
                specific patients where a nutritional assessment and intervention has been requested by a doctor or
                nurse, for example if a patient has lost their ability to swallow or requires artificial nutrition due
                to intestinal failure. Dietitians are the only regulated healthcare professionals licensed to assess,
                diagnose, and treat such problems. In the United Kingdom, dietitian is a 'protected title', meaning
                identifying yourself as a dietitian without appropriate education and registration is prohibited by law.

            <p>The number of calories in a food refers to the amount of energy stored in that food. Your body uses
                calories from food for walking, thinking, breathing, and other important functions.

                The average person needs about 2,000 calories every day to maintain their weight, but the amount will
                depend on their age, sex, and physical activity level.

                Males tend to need more calories than females, and people who exercise need more calories than people
                who don’t.</p>

            <h4>Santa Fe Corn Salad</h4>
            <p>Corn lovers will go crazy for these 3 summer salads. If you want to give your salad some smoky flavor,
                try grilling the cobs instead of boiling them. We <3 grilled corn, and the smokiness would totally
                    compliment all the fresh vegetables and herbs you're adding to the mix. If you don't have a grill
                    (or the time) frozen roasted corn would be a great substitute! These salads are perfect for potlucks
                    or block parties. You can assemble everything the night before and refrigerate, then dress the
                    salads right before serving. </p>

            <h4>Homemade Pickles</h4>
            <p>Trim ends from cucumbers and slice into spears. Pack into 2 (16-oz. glass jar along with garlic and
                dill.

                Make brine: in a small saucepan, combine water, vinegar, and salt. Bring to a boil, stir until salt
                is dissolved, and remove from heat and let cool slightly. Pour over cucumbers, seal jar, and shake. Let
                cool completely on the counter, then refrigerate until cold.

                Wait at least 2 hours to eat the pickles, but the longer you wait, the more flavorful they’ll be. If
                you can, try waiting 24 hours.</p>

            <h4>Grilled Asparagus</h2>
                <p>Sure nice weather is great for the beach or the pool, but our minds immediately go to grilling. And
                    though some folks like burgers or chicken, we can't get enough of grilled vegetables. Barbecuing
                    veggies imparts even more flavor than roasting, and is usually even easier too! Not to mention
                    you'll get some gorgeous char marks too.

                    Few veggies grill up as nicely as asparagus. Thin stalks get crispy while thicker ones get tender.
                    Finish with a bit of lemon or parm and you have the perfect cookout side. AND they finish cooking in
                    under 5 minutes.</p>
